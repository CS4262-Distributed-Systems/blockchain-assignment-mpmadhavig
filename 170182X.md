# Blockchain

### 1. Decentralization of the ledger

Blockchain technology uses a ledger to keep record of the transactions. It is immutable and distributed in the peers of the blockchain network. Because the ledger is distributed, there is no central point of control. Hence, it is extremely difficult to alter the past transactions by means of a network network or any other way.

### 2. Proof of Work

Proof of Work is a consensus mechanism used in blockchain. It provides the peers in the network a mathematical problem to be solved which requires significant amount of computation. As a result, it prevents any adversary from taking over the network. When a new transaction has to be recorded, miners who are participating needs to complete the Proof of Work to get permission to add the new block to the ledger.
